If you love computers and good Shows, it's possible that you have seen something like Lain or MR Robot,
well I think that it's really cool to get to know that well your stuff, to not just go to the surface but to go really deep
into the things you love, specially in this age of LLM's and Data lakes, so why dont we become a little bit more like
those characters, you know... a ***POWER USER!!!***
## What is a Power User?
A Power User is someone who wants to take his computer and whatever he has to the maximum peak of performance or use cases,
it's about an attitude, about a way of looking learning and technology

you want your own chromecast? get your hands on a rapsberry pi, some cables and there you have it
You want to know how netflix works under the hood? maybe to use some cli tools or NVIM instead of something more usual? spend some time on it!
you want your own mail server? learn, research and then get Hacked and lost all your bank accounts!!
## Essential Tips to Become a Power User
- Dont be afraid of breaking things: It's okey, you are learning and every mistakes it's going to take your knowledge to the next level
- Use resources and be smart: Use youtube, documentation, LLM's you named it, but whatever you use use it to know more, not to skip brain usage
- Be curious: Ask your teachers, your friends or on internet about what makes you curious, try to go more deep than most people and
try to learn about the more mundane stuff, games, systems, architecture, and yeah even how your shower works.
This last one could look weird, but remember it's about a mindset and how you see the world
## Recommended Tools & Resources
I would look for documentation and books that leet you know to the actual level of knowledge you have. For the youtube one I
would highly Recommended the next channels:
- Bugswriter: To learn about what can a power use actually make
- Distrotube: to learn about this insane world of OS
- Mentaloutlaw OR LukeSmith: To learn more about FOOS mindset
